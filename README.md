<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->
Code and documents from [misig repository](https://github.com/natgoodman/misig) that aren't needed for posted blog posts or working papers, and that aren't likely to be used in posted material any time soon. This is basically a dusty attic for code and documents I'm not using but don't want to lose. Some of the code works and some is hopelessly broken. Sorry.

**THE SOFTWARE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THE CODE IS ROUGH and SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION NONEXISTENT. MUCH OF THE CODE DOESN'T WORK!! PLEASE GET IN TOUCH IF YOU NEED HELP**

Please report bugs, other software problems, and feature requests using the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/natgoodman/misigXper/issues). I will be notified, and you'll be apprised of progress. As already noted, the software is still rough and software documentation nonexistent.
